Tennis-Scorekeeper
==================

Keeps track of tennis scores for 1, 3, and 5 set matches

My tennis score keeper is a simple C++ program that obtains two players or two pairs of doubles teams and can be used to keep track of a score in a real tennis match by typing in "1" or "2" depending on who won the point.
